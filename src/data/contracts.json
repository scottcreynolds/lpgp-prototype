  "content": "Contracts are agreements between players that define cooperative gameplay, providing a mechanism that for players to trade resources and currency to advance their goals.\n\nPlayers can create contracts with other players during the Governance phase only, and those contracts can be for a one-time exchange, a permanent arrangement, or an agreement to operate for a set number of rounds. Successfully maintaining and completing contracts will award REP and also show your fellow players that you can be trusted to uphold your agreements. However, at any time, one player can choose to break a contract for a REP penalty if they deem it in their best interests.\n\n## Examples\n\n- **Player 1** offers **Player 2** 5 EV per round in exchange for 10 power capacity at Player 2's Solar Array.\n\n- **Player 3** and **Player 4** agree to exchange 10 of Player 3's crew capacity for 10 of Player 4's solar capacity for the next 3 rounds.\n\n- **Player 1** can't build mining equipment, so they offer **Player 2**, who is a Resource Extractor, 20 EV + purchase cost to build a Helium-3 Extractor on their behalf."
