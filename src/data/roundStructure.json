  "content": "The game is structured into rounds, each consisting of two phases: Governance and Operations. We start with a *Setup* phase and each round has an end-of-round accounting process.\n\n## Setup\n\nDuring Setup, players choose what kind of Lunar Company they want to represent and which specialization fits their goals and playstyle. More interested in mining resources for direct profit? You probabbly want to be a *Resource Extractor*. Want to provide crucial services to other players? You could be an *Operations Manager*. Want to do a little of everything? The *Infrastructure Provider* is for you.\n\nAfter you decide on your player, take a look at the game board, decide on your strategy, and start thinking about what kind of things you need to build and contracts you might want to make.\n\n## Governance\n\nGovernance involves creating contracts, planning, and bringing up issues for discussion and vote among the other players as necessary. The player with the highest REP gets some special abilities in the Governance phase. Also, Governance is the **only phase** where you can make contracts, so plan accordingly and make sure you have the deals in place for the resources you need.\n\n## Operations\n\nOperations is where you execute the planned actions, build and place your infrastructure, and collect your earnings. Pay special attention to your resources and your ROI in this phase, and be thinking about what you need to do in the next Governance phase to get ahead."
