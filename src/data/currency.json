  "content": "Currency in the game represents the economic and social resources players use to build infrastructure, fulfill contracts, and advance their strategies.\n\n## EV: \n\nGained by operating excavators and selling power and crew capacity. Lost via maintenance and upkeep costs, or investing in more infrastructure.\n\nEV is your financial resource that gives you purchase and operational power. You can choose to gain EV primarily through mining and refinement operations or by leasing or selling infrastructure and resources like power and crew to other players.\n\n## REP: \n\nGained by entering into and upholding contracts. Lost by breaking contracts.\n\nReputation points reflect a player's standing with the other players in the game. High REP can unlock special opportunities, like right of first action in the Governance Phase or tiebreak vote in the case of a group decision. REP might also be counted toward your total win conditions, based on game configuration. On the other hand, players with low REP may find it harder to get other players to make deals or get help when needed.\n\nPlayers must manage their currency wisely, balancing immediate needs with long-term goals to succeed in the game."
