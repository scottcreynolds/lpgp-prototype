## Notes & Next Steps – Phase Timer (Appended)

### Timer Notes

- Timer state is managed client-side in Zustand and keyed per phase per round (e.g., `${round}:${phase}`).
- Default duration is 5 minutes; users can edit minutes. Editing pauses the timer and clamps remaining time if needed.
- While running, remaining time updates every second; when it reaches 0 the display turns red, the timer auto-pauses, and a dialog is shown.

### Timer Next Steps

- Persistence options:
  - Add Zustand persist middleware to store timers in localStorage (survives reloads, single-client scope).
  - Or add DB schema + RPCs for timers to sync across clients and hook into real-time invalidations.
- Auto-advance (optional):
  - On expiry, prompt to advance phase automatically and call `advance_phase` (respect optimistic locking using `version`).
- UX enhancements:
  - Add audio alert on expiry and a toast message.
  - Provide quick duration presets (e.g., 3/5/10 minutes) and a “+1 min” button.
- Testing:
  - Unit tests for timer store actions (start, pause, reset, duration edit, expiry).
  - Component tests for `PhaseTimer` interactions and dialog behavior.
- Lint cleanup:
  - Fix existing `react-refresh/only-export-components` and empty-interface errors in `src/components/ui/color-mode.tsx` and `src/components/ui/toaster.tsx` by moving shared constants/functions to separate files.

## Dark/Light Mode Color Audit – 2025-11-05

Goal: Replace hardcoded color values with Chakra v3 semantic tokens (e.g., `bg`, `fg`, `fg.muted`, `border`) or component `colorPalette` usage so the UI adapts to dark/light modes automatically.

Guidelines:

- Prefer semantic tokens: `bg`, `fg`, `fg.muted`, `border`, etc.
- For statuses (success/warning/danger/info), prefer `colorPalette` on supported components and avoid raw `red.50`/`green.700`.
- For icons (react-icons), prefer `color="currentColor"` by wrapping in a Chakra component with a token color or use Chakra's `Icon` with tokens.

### Components to update (file and props)

- [ ] `src/components/GameStateDisplay.tsx`
  - [ ] Replace `bg="white"` with `bg="bg"` (container surface)
  - [ ] Replace `borderColor="gray.200"` with `borderColor="border"`
  - [ ] Replace heading `color="gray.900"` with `color="fg"`
  - [ ] Replace meta text `color="gray.700"` with `color="fg.muted"`

- [ ] `src/components/PhaseTimer.tsx`
  - [ ] Replace `bg="gray.100"` with `bg="bg"` (or a `subtle` surface if defined)
  - [ ] Replace `borderColor="gray.300"` with `borderColor="border"`
  - [ ] Replace label `color="gray.800"` with `color="fg"`
  - [ ] Replace `timeColor` from `'red.600' | 'gray.900'` to tokens (e.g., `color="fg"` normally and apply `colorPalette="red"` + variant or `color="fg"` with emphasis and an error badge)

- [ ] `src/components/PlayerRankings.tsx`
  - [ ] Replace card `bg="white"` with `bg="bg"`
  - [ ] Replace `borderColor="gray.200"` with `borderColor="border"`
  - [ ] Replace heading `color="gray.900"` with `color="fg"`
  - [ ] Replace header row `bg="gray.100"` with semantic surface (e.g., `bg="bg"` and use font weight for emphasis)
  - [ ] Replace column header `color="gray.900"` with `color="fg"`
  - [ ] Replace winner EV `color='green.600'` with a token or `colorPalette="green"` on a badge/text
  - [ ] Replace REP negative `color='red.700'` with token or `colorPalette="red"`

- [ ] `src/components/EditPlayerModal.tsx`
  - [ ] Replace helper text `color="gray.700"` with `color="fg.muted"`

- [ ] `src/components/InfrastructureCards.tsx`
  - [ ] Replace section heading `color="gray.900"` with `color="fg"`
  - [ ] Replace card `bg="white"` with `bg="bg"`
  - [ ] Replace `borderColor="gray.200"` with `borderColor="border"`
  - [ ] Replace title/text `color="gray.900"` with `color="fg"`
  - [ ] Replace labels `color="gray.800"`/`gray.600` with `fg`/`fg.muted`
  - [ ] Replace power alert backgrounds `red.50`/`blue.50`, borders `red.200`/`blue.200`, and icon hex `#C53030`/`#3182CE` with semantic or `colorPalette`-based styling
  - [ ] Replace crew alert backgrounds `red.50`/`green.50`, borders `red.200`/`green.200`, and icon hex `#C53030`/`#38A169` similarly
  - [ ] Replace EV/Income boxes `orange.50`/`orange.200` and `green.50`/`green.200` with semantic or `colorPalette` tokens
  - [ ] Replace yield `color="green.700"` with token or `colorPalette="green"`
  - [ ] Replace misc `color="gray.800"` with `fg`

- [ ] `src/components/AddPlayerModal.tsx`
  - [ ] Replace helper text `color="gray.600"` with `color="fg.muted"`

- [ ] `src/components/DashboardHeader.tsx`
  - [ ] Replace header bar `bg="white"` with `bg="bg"`
  - [ ] Replace `borderColor="gray.200"` with `borderColor="border"`

- [ ] `src/components/Dashboard.tsx`
  - [ ] Replace error panel `bg="red.50"`, `borderColor="red.200"`, `color="red.700"/"red.600"` with an `Alert` using `colorPalette="red"` or semantic tokens
  - [ ] Replace page `bg="gray.50"` with `bg="bg"`
  - [ ] Replace section heading `color="gray.900"` with `color="fg"`

- [ ] `src/components/GameStateDisplay.tsx` (post-Setup adjustments if any remain)
  - [ ] Ensure any remaining hardcoded grays/whites are swapped for semantic tokens

Notes:

- Keep contrast in dark mode (avoid overly subtle tokens for critical text).
- Verify existing custom theme exposes `bg`, `fg`, `fg.muted`, `border` (usage is present elsewhere in repo).
- Where component-level `colorPalette` isn’t available, apply token colors via `color`/`bg` on a wrapper Box.

## New: Setup Phase & Round Start

- [x] Add explicit Setup phase (pre-first-round) with no timer
- [x] Default new game to Setup (round 0)
- [x] Show "Begin Round 1" button in Setup that advances to Round 1 – Governance
- [x] Add Setup tips modal (defaults open) with icon toggle
- [ ] Update docs/rules to mention Setup workflow
